This file uses two modules and is intended to provide small working example an html page rendering top 6 movie posters with its trailers.  

The modules strive to be simple, well documented and modification friendly to help developers quickly learn the code with a little reading and hands on experience.

Suggestions, corrections and new examples are welcome. 

Setup

1. Install the webbrowser module
2. Make sure the three files - media.py, entertainment.py and freshtomatoes.py are in the same folder.
3. Run the entertainment.py file in the folder
4. Ta-da! The examples will appear in your browser. You can click on the movie's image to play it's associated trailer.

Now you can read the code and it's comments and see the result, experiment with it, and hopefully quickly grasp it's working.
